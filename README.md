# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
  This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the linear regression algorithm. We will be using a dataset containing various features of houses along with their corresponding prices. The linear regression model will be trained on this data to learn the relationship between the features and house prices, and then used to make predictions on new data.

#Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

Avg. Area Income
Avg. Area House Age
Avg. Area Number of Rooms
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
Area Population
Price (target variable)

#Libraries Used
We will be using the following Python libraries for this project:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy: For numerical operations
matplotlib: For data visualization
seaborn: For advanced data visualization
scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model and evaluation
